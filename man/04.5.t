Designer Ships
.sp
.PP
A feature of TREK73 allows you to have more than just the standard
four ship types.
The programs
.I bpv
(6) and
.I shipyard
(6) allows new ship types to be created.
.I Shipyard
in conjunction with the -F and/or -l command line option allows
battle between, say, the Enterprise and the Death Star.

See the manual pages for
.I bpv
and
.I shipyard
for more information about designer ships.

English Parser
.PP
The latest feature of TREK73 Version 4.0 is the addition of
a rudimentary English parser.
No longer does the player have to remember what code number
corresponds to what command.
.PP
A full list of allowable commands would nearly double
the length of this document.
Suffice it to say that it was the designers' desire
to allow commands to be typed in just as if they would be spoken.
An example of a legitimate command would be:
"Pursue the Albatross at warp 6.5".
Another would be:
"Lock all tubes onto the Devastator".
.PP
If a given phrase does not work, try modifying the words or the
order of the words.
Some words, especially if they are long, may be abbreviated.
.PP
If all else fails, then bite the bullet and memorize
the command numbers.
